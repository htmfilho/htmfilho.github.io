I came back from a 10 days vacation in Brazil with 103kg, in August 2016. A
month later, returning to the european diet and getting rid of all the water
retained in my body due to the salty Brazilian food. I've reached 101kg. For my
height, I was clearly obese, feeling unconfortable with my daily life.
Everything was more difficult to do, I was feeling unaturally lasy, umotivated,
heavy. It made me constantly think about going back to the gim, but I was tired
of paying for it in the past without actually going. I thought about buying a
threadmill or an ergonometric bike, but after a while, I know they would become
part of the decoration. I also thought if I wanted to engage in something then
it would need to become a habit or part of my daily routine. I thought about
going to work by bike or walking but it rains a lot here in Belgium, which would
break my routine.
