## Do Explicit Demonstrations of Self-Promotion

You can always do it on the mirror, but it is very hard to do it in front of other people without sounding snobbish. From the moment people think you are snobbish, they will question you more frequently and you will have a hard time to convince them.

## Teach Good Practices and Behave in the Opposite Way

## Ignore The Context of the Organization

## Abandon the Project Without Offering a Proper Handout

## Leave Without Transferring The Knowledge or The Technology

## Propose a Solution or Methodology Without Having Any Previous Experience



## Use Company's Resources for Personal Needs
