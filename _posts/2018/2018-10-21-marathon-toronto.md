It came sooner than expected. In my post about the [20 kilometers of Brussels][20kmdebruxelles], I mentioned I expected to run a couple of half-marathons before going to a full marathon, initially planned for 2019. Then I decided to anticipate it after getting too resilient in the process of migrating to Canada.

We are now living in Toronto, the forth larger city in North America, but it feels like a relatively small city because of the friendly neightbohood.

# The Mental Workout

During the second half I imagined running the first half as a reference, like mentally visualizing where I was in the first half based on the kilometers of the second half. Thinking about an imediate successful achievement was a very good distraction. It felt like a mindful experience because I could forget about the pain in my legs. 

My training was concentrated at 5:30am 3 times a week in several weather conditions.
