This is a compilation of what I know so far about the pandemic that is in course. I started writing this post in April 2nd and I keep contributing with content as I learn more about the situation. My goal is to compile knowledge today to be used some time in the future in case a pandemic crisis happens again.

## Tests

The reason why tests are so important is because it allows preparation to what is yet to come. In the case of COVID-19, it is known that 80% of people go through with mild symptoms, 20% need some level of hospitalization, 5% need intensive care, and 2% die. By knowing how many people are sick, we take these percentages of the total, prepare the hospitals for the volume of new patients over time and we also alert the suply chain about the iminent demand. The sooner the tests happen the better because it buys time. The lack of preparation leads to overloaded hospitals, contamination of existing patients, contamination of health professionals, who have to stop working until being tested negative again, among other chaotic situations.

Work in progress every day...
