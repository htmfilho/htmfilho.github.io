I was visiting the blog of a [touching story](http://mrbraga.blogspot.com/">friend</a>, when I read a very <a href="http://mrbraga.blogspot.com/2010/04/do-abraco.html) that he was sharing in his last post. The story was originally published in a newspaper in my hometown. So, I decided to translate the story and publish it here because I believe it’s good to spread this kind of message.

According to him, in the country side of Brazil, a [redneck](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/redneck) was talking so calmly that he seemed to measure, analyze and meditate about every word he was saying…

> “Yeah… of all men’s inventions, the one that makes sense the most is the **hug**. There is no way of not enjoying a hug! Everybody, during a hug, participates a little bit…

When you are missing someone, the hug of someone else relieves you. When you are angry and receive a hug, you even feel ashamed of that bad feeling. If you are happy and hugs someone else, this person will get a little bit of your happiness. If someone is ill and you hug her/him, she/he starts getting better and you get better as well.

A lot of important and cult people have tried to understand why the hug is so ‘hightech’, but nobody has figured it out yet.

I have no clue too either! I would say that it was a nice spirit from God who told me that and I’m going to tell you what he told me: **The hug is good because of the heart. When you hug someone you do a massage on your heart and the heart of the other one is massaged too**. But this isn’t all. The real key of the biggest secret is:

**When we hug someone, both get two hearts on the chest**. So, sending a big and warming hug for you.”
