The history tell us good and bad experiences that we learn to make decisions for the future. But we know that the context has a strong influence on the decision process despite human behavior and intuition. Now, imagine to feel the past in a place where strategic decisions were taken some centuries ago. This place is Carcassonne.

<a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/DSCN1382_1.jpg">![DSCN1382_1-300x225.jpg](/images/posts/DSCN1382_1-300x225.jpg)</a>Carcassonne is a small city in the south of France, which had its earliest nucleus created by romans 3 centuries before Christ (BC). It was invaded by barbarians, visigoths, arabs and others, because of the strategic position in the route between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The constant incursions transformed Carcassonne in a fortified city, where an amazing castle  was built around 1130 AC. France was the last kingdom to invade the city and attach the region to its current territory. The castle was an important army center until 17th century and almost demolished in 19th century. The antiquary and mayor of Carcassonne, Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille, and the writer Prosper Mérimée, the first inspector of ancient monuments, led a campaign to preserve the fortress as a historical monument. Later, the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, already at work restoring the Basilica of Saint-Nazaire, was commissioned to renovate the place. Today, the castle was added to the UNESCO list of World Iteritage Sites in 1997.

I visited Carcassonne this weekend and I could feel the context where war decisions were taken and strategies of medieval attacks and defenses were planned and executed. It is possible to imagine the difficult logistic to keep everything working and ready to an eminent confront. Nowadays, organizations have more facilities to make decisions, but decisions have become more frequent and complex. Even with a complete information system support, like Planexstrategy, the decision process is surrounded by uncertainties.
