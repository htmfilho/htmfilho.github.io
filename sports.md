When I rediscovered sports with 38 years old, I also found ways to do good.

## Swimming for Hôpi Clown

Hôpi Clown gives hospitalized children the power to play and laugh to better
cope with the disease. The child out of his usual environment can be 
entertained in many ways: laughter, storytelling, play, clowning, singing, 
music, puppetry and painting.

## Running for ELA

[ELA](ela) is an European association against the leucodystrophies. It's a
group of orphan genetic diseases. Leukodystrophies destroy the central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) of children and adults. They affect the myelin,
a white substance that envelops the nerves at the way of an electrical sheath.
