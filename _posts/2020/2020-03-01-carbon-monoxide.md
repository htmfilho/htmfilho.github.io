![Mark and his brother in The Client](/images/posts/the-client.png)

Mark was eleven and has been smoking since nine. He mostly relied on the two packs his mother was smoking a day to steal some for himself. One day, he went to a ride with his little brother in the woods around the neighborhood. While he was teaching his brother to smoke, a car parked in the middle of the trees. Hidden, they saw a fat man get out of the car, attach a hose in the scaping pipe, put the other end through the window, and turn the car on to get himself dead of asphyxiation. Mark was determined to prevent that suicidal attempt, so he crawled to the car, removed the hose and run back to his hiding place. The man felt it was taking too long to die, so he went back there just to notice the hose out. He fixed the hose and got locked again. The boy and the man kept doing this until the man noticed the boy, captured him and got both locked in the car, saying: "We will die together".

It could be a true story if it wasn't the intriguing plot of the novel "The Client" by John Grisham. He certainly based his fiction on real facts though, since thousands of lives are interrupted every year because of gas poisoning. One of the most lethal gases out there is the carbon monoxide, but a lot of people don't know the difference from the carbon dioxide, which is a quite popular gas these days because of the believe that it is the main cause of the climate crisis. I intend to clarify the difference and explain why you should be more concerned about the monoxide than the dioxide.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the result of a reaction in which a hydrocarbon (an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon, like most of fuels) reacts with oxygen to produce CO2 and water. Unfortunately, you cannot see or feel this gas because it’s colorless and odorless but you can be sure of its presence when you watch a candle burn or you exhale after inhale. It is essential for the life on earth because it is part of natural cycles, but many scientists believe that the excess of this gas may lead to global warming.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is the result of a reaction in which a hydrocarbon also reacts with oxygen but in an environment with a limited supply of air, resulting in less oxygen in the molecule. Because of the abundance of oxygen in the air, CO doesn’t occur naturally in the atmosphere, but industrialized equipment, that we can find at our home or office, can produce high levels of this gas. Fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, stoves, dryers, water heaters, fireplaces, and cars are well known emitters of this colorless and odorless gas that can only be detected with special sensors.

Both gases are dangerous for human beings but the lethal concentration varies. CO2 poisoning is rare because it requires a high concentration of it in a confined space, leading to symptoms like headaches and dizziness before the feeling of suffocation, which triggers the search for fresh air. On the other hand, CO is far more dangerous. It attaches to blood cells and prevents the distribution of oxygen throughout the body, causing a silent and painless lethal intoxication.

The best way to prevent gas intoxication is to ensure air circulation in the area. It can be done by simply opening the window, the door, or turning on the exhaust fan. But when it is not convenient to do, due to extreme weather conditions outside or the design of the building or the presence of a high emitter of those gases in the room, then it is crucial to consider installing a sensor.

Each gas requires its own sensor.
