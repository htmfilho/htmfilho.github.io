![Finishing the race](/images/posts/ten-miles-lln.jpg)

Today, I've run my longest distance yet: 10 miles (16 km)! This is a relatively short distance for veterans, but a level before a half-marathon. I'm very happy because it was completely over my expectations. I knew I would finish it, because I have been training regularly, but not that close to 1h30.

The 10 miles of Louvain-la-Neuve is a race made by students for students, but everybody can participate. "It's the biggest student race in the country and some people come from far away to take part of it." - [Romain Lambert][dh-belgium].

Every year the profit is donated to charity. This year they will donate to "Escalpade", a specialized school for children, adolescents and adults with disabilities.
