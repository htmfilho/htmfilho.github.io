To run long distances, I had to learn how to control my pace, to keep it stable over several kilometres. It is all about controlling my rhythm, trying to mimic my previous movement and replicate it to the next movement. When I keep the rhythm stable, I get consistent pace measures over the course. This is important to avoid going too fast at the beginning or too slow at the end.
