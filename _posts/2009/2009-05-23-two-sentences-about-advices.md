This week two sentences about “advices” called my attention:

> “_People who ask our advice almost never take it. Yet we should never refuse to give it, upon request, for it often helps us to see our own way more clearly._” – Brendan Francis


> “_The true secret of giving advice is, after you have honestly given it, to be perfectly indifferent whether it is taken or not, and never persist in trying to set people right._” – Hannah Whitall Smith


My understanding is that we have to be good people to give good advices and do not expect that people will follow them. It sounds like the principle of forgiveness and generosity, which we can give and do not expect anything in return.

To conclude, a sentence extracted from the book of <a href="http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/">Randy Pausch</a>, <a href="http://www.thelastlecture.com/">The Last Lecture</a>:

> “_Almost every day I mention my dad. I do this because when you try to teach something new, most people tend not to pay attention. But if you refer to the experience of someone else, everything seems less arrogant and more acceptable._” – Randy Pausch
