Last year Mr. Obama won the Peace Nobel Prize. There was a lot of controversy about this prize because the president of the United States didn‚Äôt do anything concrete to bring peace to the world. I, particularly, didn‚Äôt like the Nobel commission‚Äôs choice for this prize. So, in order to fix this hasty decision, I would like to suggest a name for 2010: <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/">Jamie Oliver</a>, the famous British chef! What???

His mission statement seems really touching, inspiring and reachable actually.

Doing this, Jamie could save millions of lives all over the world reducing the obesity statistics and, consequently, making people feel really happy for doing something definitively useful, which is: feed people. Watch his message in this video below. It is more than convincing, it‚Äôs touching.

You may think I‚Äôm exaggerating, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm 31 years old and I started to cook at 30, less than 1 year ago. I know by a matter of fact what Jamie is trying to say. I know how good cooking means for mental health :D. If you have a family to care about and you go to the kitchen with the mission to feed them, you see exactly your importance in other people‚Äôs life cycle in the simplest way possible. That‚Äôs why cooking is worth experiencing.

These two pictures below show two of Jamie‚Äôs recipes that we have made at home and they are simply amazing.
