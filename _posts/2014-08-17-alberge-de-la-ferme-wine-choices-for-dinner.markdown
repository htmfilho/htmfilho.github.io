I never had the opportunity to write about the experience at <a href="http://www.aubergedelaferme.com" target="_blank">Auberge de la Ferme</a>. I will do it in another opportunity because now I just want to share our wine choices for dinner. They have an extensive selection of wines in a big cave and every time we go there we spend a lot of time choosing the right one, hoping it is good enough for the occasion.

This time we made a very good choice at a good price. They are:

<h3>Montravel</h3>

We had a gastronomic dinner with 7 services and most of the dishes demanded a white wine. We choose Montravel, that was one of theÂ <span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">waiter</span></span>â€˜s suggestions. This is a very good 12% dry andÂ <span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en" tabindex="-1"><span class="hps">fruity</span></span> wine 2013.

<h3>Julienas</h3>

Some of the dishes demanded a red wine. So, we once again accepted one of the <span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">waiter</span></span>â€˜s suggestions. The dry, 13% red wine JuliÃ©nas 2011.

We still areÂ <span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en" tabindex="-1"><span class="hps">amateurs</span></span> in the art of wine appreciation. So, Iâ€™m saving the choices here for the next time ðŸ™‚ .
