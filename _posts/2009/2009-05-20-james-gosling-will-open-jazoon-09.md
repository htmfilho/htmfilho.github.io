I won’t be able to attend Jazoon’09 this [time](http://jazoon.com/en.html). Instead, I’m going to present a research paper in a [conference held in Saint Petersburg, Russia](http://www.specom.nw.ru/specom_e.html). You know, I’m a researcher at this moment and this kind of conference has more priority for me. I’ve attended [Jazoon’07](http://jazoon.com/jazoon07/en.html) and [Jazoon’08](http://jazoon.com/jazoon08/en.html) and I do recommend Jazoon’09 for you. In 2008 I even gave a talk there, representing my [Java User Group](http://www.cejug.org/), which was indeed a great moment for me.

Zurich is great, the weather is perfect and people are nice. You’re gonna have fun there, for sure. I feel bad for not going this year because I miss [Christian Frey](http://jazoon.com/en/sponsorsandpartners/producer.html), Jazoon’s General Manager, who is a great person. He is that kind of person who is really committed to make everything perfect for you even with all difficulties. I also miss my dear friend [Felipe Gaúcho](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/felipegaucho/), who is a great Java professional working in Zurich, Switzerland. You will find him at Jazoon for sure, drinking a lot of beers. Btw, the beer is for free there ;).

This year James Gosling, the creator of the Java language, will be the opening-keynote speaker of the conference. I’ve met James in the last edition of JavaPolis in 2007 (Now it is called [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com/)). It’s really nice to shake his hand, say hello and take some pictures. Don’t miss the opportunity to meet the guy who created the language that gave you a great job!
