Last year Mr. Obama won the Peace Nobel Prize. There was a lot of controversy about this prize because the president of the United States didn’t do anything concrete to bring peace to the world. I, particularly, didn’t like the Nobel commission’s choice for this prize. So, in order to fix this hasty decision, I would like to suggest a name for 2010: [Jamie Oliver](http://www.jamieoliver.com/), the famous British chef! What???

Jamie figured out that he can actually change the world by changing people’s eating habits. His mission statement seems really touching, inspiring and reachable actually.

> “I wish for your help to create a strong, sustainable movement to educate every child about food, inspire families to cook again and empower people everywhere to fight obesity.”


Doing this, Jamie could save millions of lives all over the world reducing the obesity statistics and, consequently, making people feel really happy for doing something definitively useful, which is: feed people. Watch his message in this video below. It is more than convincing, it’s touching.

You may think I’m exaggerating, but I’m not. I’m 31 years old and I started to cook at 30, less than 1 year ago. I know by a matter of fact what Jamie is trying to say. I know how good cooking means for mental health :D. If you have a family to care about and you go to the kitchen with the mission to feed them, you see exactly your importance in other people’s life cycle in the simplest way possible. That’s why cooking is worth experiencing.

These two pictures below show two of Jamie’s recipes that we have made at home and they are simply amazing.

Look at the details about Jamie’s plan <a href="http://www.tedprize.org/jamie-oliver/">here</a> and start helping him to accomplish this by just spreading the wonderful art of cooking. If somehow you are not motivated enough, watch the movie <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/julieandjulia/">Julie &amp; Julia</a> and you will be sufficiently motivated. Trust me! 😉
