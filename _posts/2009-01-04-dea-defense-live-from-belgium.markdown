It has been so long since we left Brazil to study in Belgium. The experience here has been so grateful, plenty of achievements, good moments, new friends from all over the world, new emotions and self-discovering, in a maturity process two times faster than in Brazil, where everything was under control.

However, a striking experience comes out when we stop to think about our journey until now. Our undergraduate course at <a href="http://www.unifor.br/">University of Fortaleza</a> (Unifor) was where everything we have today started.

Unifor was responsible for our high education, giving us all the instruments to be well recognized in the industry and academy. There, we had the biggest amount of friends ever, with whom we learned to work as a team and have fun as much as we could. We are still good friends with most of our teachers, frequently interacting with them about research and good memories.

Thanks to the great relationship we have with people at Unifor, we could count on them to evaluate our progress here, since they know us very well to precisely advice us to go further on our researches. Dr. <a href="http://vfurtado.blogspot.com/">Vasco Furtado</a>, on the field of Artificial Inteligence, and Dra. Elizabeth Furtado, on the field of Human-computer Interaction, were members of the jury of my and KÃªniaâ€™s DEA dissertations, respectively. We have been working with them since 2002, when I received a scholarship to work with research and KÃªnia got the same opportunity months later.

This collaborations was so valuable and Unifor knew how to make it special and unforgettable, being so kind to record a report about this experience through TV Unifor, an internal tv channel focused on news about the campus. You can watch it below. The video is in Portuguese, but we added subtitles, since most of my visitors donâ€™t speak Portuguese.

If I donâ€™t become a recognized researcher I will be, at least, famous in my city ðŸ˜‰
