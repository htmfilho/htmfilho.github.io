    mitigate that.

- title: The Beauty of Discomfort
  author: Amanda Lang
  description: <p>My family and I spent wonderful holidays in Canada this year
    and I found this book in a Toronto bookstore, writen by a Canadian
    bestselling author. Amanda proves her point about discomfort by telling
    stories of people who have endured through their challenging achievements.
    She made sure the stories were sufficiently different to cover most aspects
    of discomfort. After finishing the book, it was clear to me that discomfort
    is actually a personal game changer, but there is no beauty in it. So,
    "Discomfort" would be enough as a title.</p>

    <p>It was a pleasure to read this book. The text was really straight,
    written in a journalistic style, almost like a modern documentary, crafted
    to attract reader's attention.</p>

    <p>I'm currently going through several changing processes, facing discomfort
    in many levels. By reading this book I found the necessary assurance that
    all I'm going through will effectively bring the results I'm looking for. I
    just have to be patient, given that patience is another form of
    discomfort.</p>

- title: Your Code as a Crime Scene
  author: Adam Tornhill
  description: <p>The book is good at investigating design issues, but not good
    at solving them. Problems are exposed, but not discussed. The tools
    presented aren't more than scripts that have to be executed manually and in
    the right sequence. There is no dashboard or some sort of continuous
    automated analysis to show the progress of the actions taken after the
    diagnosis.</p>

    <p>The text emphasizes the approach of analyzing the history of changes in
    files based on version control logs, but I personally think that all
    diagnosis shown in the book can also be done by a static analysis tool like
    SonaQube.</p>

    <p>Chapter 10, "Use Beauty as a Guiding Principle", was the most relevant
    chapter for me. It really opened my mind to some aspects of programming. It
    made the book worth reading.</p>

- title: Programming Beyond Practices
  author: Gregory T. Brown
  description: Excellent book! Quite thin but valuable. The author explores the
    topics, which go from requirements discovery and rapid prototyping to
    business analysis and design for maintainability, describing real world
    situations. It is in the same category of The Phoenix Project and The Goal,
    but with more technical details and organized in short stories, instead of a
    long novel.

- title: Unusual Uses For Olive Oil
  author: Alexander McCall Smith
  description: Excellent book indeed! It's actually a big surprise to read a
    book published in 2011 that sounds like a classical from the 30's. It uses
    an irreproachable British English, with a modern vocabulary, of course. The
    characters have a provincial behaviour, running stories full of naiveness
    and simplicity, which are the main ingredients of this great comedy.
    Recommended!

- title: The Cicle
  author: Dave Eggers
  description: The book has a point, a very valid point about lack of privacy
    that leads to totalitarianism, but it was so badly written, with so fragile
    arguments. That's like using StarWars to show democracy is good, but no body
    thinks about politics when watching StarWars. The stories were hard to
    believe, weakly founded, almost scientific fiction, to show that social
    networking may have some sort of hipnotic power over the population while
    robotics might be the real threat nowadays.

- title: This Is Me
  author: Ian Thorpe
  description: Very good book! Despite been labeled as an autobiography and
    written in first person, the book was actually written by a English ghost
    writer. Ian lost a great opportunity to be honest about his sexuality. But
    that's OK because I've learned a good deal of swimming techniques and the
    mindset of a champion.
