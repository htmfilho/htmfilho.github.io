Some time ago I <a href="http://twitter.com/htmfilho/status/1251033077">declared </a>: _“I will ALWAYS pay for music. No matter how much it costs. Music saved my day and it has a great value for me. So, I’m extremely grateful!”_. I’m here again to reinforce this message and say that it becomes more and more true in my life every day.

Actually, two special facts motivated me to write this post. The first fact is about a movie that I watched last week. The movie was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKx_14vJNZg">Mama Mia!</a> that I really recommend. The point about this movie is that it can transform an ordinary admirer of ABBA’s songs into a great fan of the band. At least, it happened to me. Right after the movie I ran to iTunes and I bought the whole disco collection of ABBA, composed of more than one hundred songs. I started to appreciate songs that I had never heard before, just because of the magic behind the lyrics.

The second fact was an amazing production of a Belgian TV, which surprised a lot of people in the train central station of Antwerp last month. How I wanted to be there to see that unexpected scene! You can see in the video below the emotional impact of such event on the mood of people around it. Even a rock fan was moved to clap his hands to “The Sound of Music” (<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thesoundofmusic/do-re-mi.htm">do, re, mi</a>):

This video must have touched you, hasn’t it? I definitively agree with ABBA when they sing:

> “So I say<br/>Thank you for the music, the songs I’m singing<br/>Thanks for all the joy they’re bringing<br/>Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty<br/>What would life be?<br/>Without a song or a dance what are we?<br/>So I say thank you for the music<br/>For giving it to me”
