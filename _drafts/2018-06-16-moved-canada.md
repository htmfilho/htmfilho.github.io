I had to tell my employer I was planning to leave the company some time in the near future. I had to convince them to give me a nice recommendation letter, as well as keep me around as long as I needed, even though I had no long term commitment with them. I needed their recommendation letter to complete the application for the [Canadian Permanent Residence][pr] (PR) via [Express Entry][express-entry]. Something I had no guarantee of success. So, all this could end up in a very awkward situation.

It seems to be intentional though. The Canadian working culture requires strong soft skills. It was a test to check how good I was with words, how much my employer appreciated my work, and how badly I wanted to move to Canada. It took a year from the day we decided to move to Canada to the day we received our PRs. It took more 3 months until we put our feet in Canadian soil. What happened during these 3 months was insane.

With the PRs in hands, there was no way back. We had to resign at work, sell the car, sell everything with some value, pack what we could in 8 bags, discard everything else, cancel all contracts including the apartment rent, make arrangements with the bank, plan the move overseas, and say goodbye to all friends.

when I wrote my resignation letter and got it signed by my direct boss and myself, all I had to do was to submit it to the director of human resources to make it effective. I will never forget when the letter passed through the narrow role of the mailbox, where a hand couldn't fit in. I was living in a very stable job, with a good salary for life, at a walking distance from home, in the heart of one of the best places to live in Belgium. It was strange, but I did it with no regrets. I was educated in a family of entrepreneurs and we love taking risks. So, my definition of stable job is the one that keeps me fed with constant challenges. From my perspective, my mission has been accomplished.

The next step was to sell the car. The task I thought would be the most challenging one, took less than 48 hours to get done. I didn't know there was such a high demand for that model to the point of having two buyers at the same time in front of my door. The money we made was good, but it destroyed our logistics. Everything else had to be done walking or with the help of friends and neighbours, for whom we are eternally grateful. Getting rid of the car was also a good thing. We got more contact with nature, we built the habit of walking to school, shopping and work, and we got the entire family fit.

With no car, selling stuff with some value was epic. We realized too late that the bigger is your home the more stuff you buy to fill in all empty spaces. We got things we used too much, some with no use at all and others we bought twice because we didn't know we already had them. We sold a lot of stuff in the neighborhood flea market   We got enough money to pay for all four one-way tickets to Canada.

The problem of getting a Canadian PR is that you don't give up this kind of thing. We would regret for live.
