I’m glad to inform that I will speak at the next <a href="http://www.brussels-jug.be/" target="_blank">Brussels JUG</a>‘s event about user experience thinking and design for business process applications. The event will take place at <a href="http://www.hubkaho.be/" target="_blank">Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel</a>, Building Hermes, on Thursday, 30th of May, at 6:30 pm. Visit Brussels JUG website for more information: <a href="http://www.brussels-jug.be/">http://www.brussels-jug.be</a>.

You won’t find a lot of information about this subject on this blog, but I have been doing research about it in parallel since 2006, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/keniasousa" target="_blank">Kênia Sousa</a>, who would be happy to share the stage, but she had to decline due to family duties. You may find more information on the page <a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/p/publications.html">Publications</a> of this blog.

If you were assigned to design and implement a business process based application, You may find this session interesting. User interface design is the most time consuming task in a software development process. It is highly subjective and under heavy criticism by end-users. This presentation will help you better deal with this problem, exploring strategies to represent business processes in a way that end-users can easily understand what they see based on their business knowledge. We will discuss about a different approach for Business-IT traceability based on UX, an architecture and a methodology to support constant process changes, navigation approaches and the right widgets for the right actions.

See you there!
