![Stock Prices](/images/posts/golang-strategy-pattern.png)

I keep searching for concrete examples in my quest to convince you that Go is a great language for business. I found in finance a great source of ideas to prove my point. I already explored this subject twice ([1](https://www.hildeberto.com/2020/04/dealing-with-money.html) and [2](https://www.hildeberto.com/2021/01/azure-function-golang.html)) and today I'm going to explore it again.

The strategy pattern is one of the simplest yet underutilized design patterns out there. It is useful when we have one goal and several ways to achieve that. In this case, our goal is to get stock prices from different stock exchanges. Each stock exchange requires a dedicated strategy to fetch the prices since they have different APIs and abstractions. The advantage of this implementation is that if we want to support a new stock exchange all we need to do is to add a new strategy. The code that calls the strategies don't change, which also prevents breaking exising tests and introducing unexpected bugs.

Formally speaking:
> "The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it."

### Using the Strategy Pattern

We start the implementation with constants that represent the stock exchanges:

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

// Supported exchanges
const (
  NASDAQ = "NASDAQ"
  NYSE   = "NYSE"
  TSX    = "TSX"
)
{% endhighlight %}

These constants can even be replaced by configuration entries to make the strategies work as plugins. That's something we can explore in a future post. For the moment, let's continue representing a stock as a struct:

{% highlight go %}
type Stock struct {
  Exchange string
  Ticker   string
  Name     string
  Price    int32
}
{% endhighlight %}

Concerning the attributes, the `Exchange` is one of those constants declared above. The `Ticker` is an acronym that represents the stock. The `Name` helps to decode the ticker. The `Price` is what we are looking for, so it will be filled later. The following `main()` function has a list of pointers to instances of Stock. Yes, we are working with the same instances from the begining to the end. You may not like the multability aspect of it, but it will help to keep the order of the original list unchanged. I honestly think this is a responsible and constructive case of multability usage, since it reduces accidental complexity.

{% highlight go %}
func main() {
  stocks := []*Stock{
    {
      Exchange: NASDAQ,
      Ticker:   "GOOGL",
      Name:     "Alphabet Inc.",
    }, {
      Exchange: NYSE,
      Ticker:   "GE",
      Name:     "General Electric CO",
    }, {
      Exchange: TSX,
      Ticker:   "SHOP",
      Name:     "Shopify Inc.", 
    }, {
      Exchange: NASDAQ,
      Ticker:   "AAPL",
      Name:     "Apple Inc.",
    }, {
      Exchange: TSX,
      Ticker:   "BMO",
      Name:     "Bank of Montreal",
    }, {
      Exchange: TSX,
      Ticker:   "CP",
      Name:     "Canadian Pacific Raiway Ltd.",
    },
  }

  stocks = getPrices(stocks)

  for _, stock := range stocks {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %d\n", stock.Ticker, stock.Price)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `main()` function works like a controller or a caller of the service fa√ßade. It calls the function `getPrices()`, which is a service function, passing the list of stocks. The function is expected to return the same list with the prices defined. In the sequence, the list is printed as an output of the program. 

The `getPrices()` function counts with the help of two other functions to be consistent with the single responsibility principle. Let's take a look at them:

{% highlight go %}
func getPrices(stocks []*Stock) []*Stock {
  exchangeCoordinator := prepareExchangeStrategies(stocks)
  return searchStocks(exchangeCoordinator, stocks)
}

func prepareExchangeStrategies(stocks []*Stock) *ExchangeCoordinator {
  exchangeCoordinator := &ExchangeCoordinator{}
  for _, stock := range stocks {
    pricing := exchangeCoordinator.GetExchangePricing(stock)
    pricing.addStock(stock)
  }
  return exchangeCoordinator
}

func searchStocks(exchangeCoordinator *ExchangeCoordinator, stocks []*Stock) []*Stock {
  for _, exchange := range exchangeCoordinator.exchanges {
    exchange.search()
  }
  return stocks
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `prepareExchangeStrategies()` function does something special. It groups stocks by exchange to optimize, if possible, the calls to the exchange pricing services. Notice it is using the exchange strategies to do the grouping (`pricing.addStock(stock)`). It would also allow making the calls in parallel (but this is not the case in this article). If your particular case doesn't need this facilities then just ignore this function and jump to the `searchStocks()`, which is the one that actually calls the strategy algorithms.

### Implemeting the Strategy Pattern

{% highlight go %}
// Pricing shapes the strategy pattern to be applied to specialized structs.
type Pricing interface {
  addStock(stock *Stock)
  search() ([]*Stock, error)
}

// ExchangesPricing holds the pricing strategies for the duration of the execution.
type ExchangesPricing struct {
  exchanges map[string]Pricing
}

// GetExchangePricing returns the Pricing based on the stock exchange.
func (ep *ExchangesPricing) GetExchangePricing(stock *Stock) Pricing {
  if ep.exchanges == nil {
    ep.exchanges = make(map[string]Pricing)
    ep.exchanges[NASDAQ] = new(NasdaqPricing)
    ep.exchanges[NYSE] = new(NYSEPricing)
    ep.exchanges[TSX] = new(TsxPricing)
  }
  return ep.exchanges[stock.Exchange]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The strategy pattern is implemented below, defining a family of algorithms to search prices on different sources.

#### NASDAQ Strategy Pattern Implementation

{% highlight go %}
// NasdaqPricing is the strategy implementation to get prices from Nasdaq.
type NasdaqPricing struct {
  stocks []*Stock
}

func (np *NasdaqPricing) addStock(stock *Stock) {
  np.stocks = append(np.stocks, stock)
}

func (np *NasdaqPricing) search() ([]*Stock, error) {
  np.stocks[0].Price = 2344500
  np.stocks[1].Price = 5439990
  return np.stocks, nil
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### NYSE Strategy Pattern Implementation

{% highlight go %}
// NYSEPricing is the strategy implementation to get prices from NYSE.
type NYSEPricing struct {
  stocks []*Stock
}

func (nyp *NYSEPricing) addStock(stock *Stock) {
  nyp.stocks = append(nyp.stocks, stock)
}

func (nyp *NYSEPricing) search() ([]*Stock, error) {
  nyp.stocks[0].Price = 344500
  return nyp.stocks, nil
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### TSX Strategy Pattern Implementation

{% highlight go %}
// TsxPricing is the strategy implementation to get prices from Tsx.
type TsxPricing struct {
  stocks []*Stock
}

func (tp *TsxPricing) addStock(stock *Stock) {
  tp.stocks = append(tp.stocks, stock)
}

func (tp *TsxPricing) search() ([]*Stock, error) {
  tp.stocks[0].Price = 8344500
  tp.stocks[1].Price = 239990
  tp.stocks[2].Price = 39990
  return tp.stocks, nil
}
{% endhighlight %}
