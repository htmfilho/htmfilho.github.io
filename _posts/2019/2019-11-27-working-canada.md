I had no previous experience, no future plans, and no ambition to work on Internet of Things, but when I recently decided to do a career move I didn't expect to do a career shift as well. But it happened and I'm loving it!

In my post [Settling in Canada][2018-07-15], I have shortly narrated how I got my first job in Toronto. A good technical fit in a fintech company. I was a tech lead in a team of three programmers, a business analyst, a test automation engineer and a product owner. We were in charge of the asset servicing business, which basically means managing the offering of investment products and the math after trades completion. It was a challenging and rewarding job and I would stay there for a long time if it wasn't for some cultural misalignments. So I decided to make myself available for new opportunities.

Normally, things get better after the first Canadian experience. If you managed to be hired, go through the three months probation period, and be stable in the job for at least a year, the market will favor you over newcomers and less experienced people and you even get the chance to negotiate. Being fired makes the situation worse though. So, make sure you are delivering more value than your pay check.

The interviews started soon after opening for new opportunities on [LinkedIn]. I was not in a hurry, since I was still employed, but recruiters kept me busy all the time. At the beginning my interviews were really a mess, given my lack of practice, but I always took notes of what went well and what went awkward. As my discourse was refining, I was moving forward in those recruitment processes, which usually take weeks. For my surprise, the winning job offer took less than 3 business days!

They hired me to help on introducing Internet of Things ([IoT]) on their platform. This is pretty surprising, given that I had absolutely no experience on anything related to IoT. I suspect they hired me because I'm an enthusiastic polyglot programmer and they wanted me to learn and use [Go] and [Groovy]. These are languages that I have no professional experience with, but I've played enough to build an opinion on them.

That was quite a move. From a leadership position to a heavy engineering one; from a busy and noisy environment to an extremely quiet team; from multiple daily meetings to almost no meetings at all; from pure Java to Go and Groovy; from web-only to web + low level + distributed + fault tolerant programming; from rigorous processes to straightforward communication. In summary, I'm spending more time on doing than on the planning of doing, which is extremely gratifying.

That was also my first professional move in Canada. It was simple but not easy. To leave, I just discussed it formally with HR, asking for procedures, and then informally with my direct boss. These are two hard conversations that I didn't want to have, but the circumstances compelled me. We came out of this with a reasonable departure date, which was enough time to handover responsibilities and the work in progress.
