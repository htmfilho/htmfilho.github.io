Letâ€™s consider that you have to create a website with a dynamic presentation and you own a technology specially made for this purpose. Strangely, you do not use your own technology to make the presentation, but the technology offered by a competitor. Is it a recognition that your own technology sucks? Is there any other explanation?

Fact: following a link shared by a friend, Iâ€™ve reached an Oracle/Sun University <a href="http://content.yudu.com/A1h149/BRTG/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=">sub-site</a> that gives detailed information about the new Java Certification Program. This website was made 100% in Flash, an Adobeâ€™s technology. You may know that Oracle/Sun created a technology called <a href="http://javafx.com/">JavaFx</a> to compete directly with Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight on the rich client market. So, why donâ€™t they use JavaFx instead?

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oracle-flash.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">![oracle-flash-300x192.png](/images/posts/oracle-flash-300x192.png)</a></div>
Making a gross comparison, Oracleâ€™s choice for Flash is like Steve Jobs, Appleâ€™s CEO, using Power Point instead of Keynote to prepare his great presentations. Or Steve Ballmer, Microsoftâ€™s CEO, using MacOS instead of Windows (<a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/?p=171">Itâ€™s possible by the way</a> ðŸ˜€ ). Can you imagine Nokiaâ€™s CEO using an iPhone? Google employees using Bing? No. But you can see JavaFxâ€™s owner using Flash. It is indeed a great recognition for Adobe, which was endorsed by a competitor as the best technology to present their products.

How would the JavaFx development community, who embraced the technology, feel? If the owner doesnâ€™t fully embrace it, why would they do it? Maybe Iâ€™m not exploring the web enough, but I havenâ€™t seen any website using JavaFx so far (I mean, <a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/?p=88">without Sunâ€™s sponsorship</a>). I donâ€™t know where the developers of the JavaFx technology can find motivation to keep working on its evolution. It has become a playground thing that people use to create demos and silly games.

Taking into consideration all benefits that HTML5 will bring in a near future, who will still consider the adoption of JavaFx in a long term perspective? This is probably the everlasting presentation language of the future. ðŸ˜€
