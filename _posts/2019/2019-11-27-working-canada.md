I had no previous experience, no future plans, and no ambition to work on Internet of Things, but when I recently decided to do a career move I didn't expect to do a career shift as well. But it happened and I'm loving it!

In my post [Settling in Canada][2018-07-15], I have shortly recounted how I got my first job in Toronto. A good technical fit in a fintech company. I was a tech lead in a team of three programmers, a business analyst, a test automation engineer and a product owner. We were in charge of the asset servicing business, which basically means managing the offering of investment products and the math after trades completion. It was a challenging and rewarding job and I would have stayed there for a long time if it wasn't for some cultural misalignments. So I decided to make myself available for new opportunities.

Normally, things get better after the first Canadian experience. If you managed to be hired, go through the three months probation period, and be stable in the job for at least a year, the market will favor you over newcomers and less experienced people and you even get the chance to negotiate. Being fired makes the situation worse though. So, make sure you are delivering value.

The interviews started soon after opening for new opportunities on [LinkedIn]. I was not in a hurry, since I was still employed, but recruiters kept me busy all the time. At the beginning my interviews were really messy, given my lack of practice, but I always took notes of what went well and what was awkward. As my discourse was refining, I was moving forward in the recruitment processes, which usually takes weeks. For my surprise, the winning job offer took less than 3 business days!

They hired me to help on introducing Internet of Things ([IoT]) on their platform. This is pretty surprising, given that I had absolutely no experience on anything related to IoT. I suspect they hired me because I'm an enthusiastic polyglot programmer and they wanted me to learn and use [Go] and [Groovy]. These are languages that I have no professional experience with, but I've played enough with them to build an opinion.

That was quite a move. From a leadership position to a heavy engineering one; from a busy and noisy environment to an extremely quiet team; from multiple daily meetings to almost no meetings at all; from pure Java to Go and Groovy; from web-only to web + low level + distributed + fault tolerant programming; from rigorous processes to straightforward communication. In summary, I'm spending more time doing rather than planning.

That was also my first professional move in Canada. To leave my previous job I just discussed it formally with HR, asking for the procedures, and then informally with my direct boss. These were two hard conversations that I didn't want to have, but the circumstances compelled me to. We came out of this with a reasonable departure date, which was enough time to handover responsibilities and the work in progress. To join the new company I signed the job offer and showed up to work on the agreed day. It was that simple, at least from the employee's point of view. I love the Canadian working relationship!!!

My assessment is in no way a general rule, but in comparison to Europe, the stakes at work here are higher. The same way it is easy to move on, it is also easy to get laid off. Funding issues can strike a good deal of people out at once with minimal legal consequences for the business. This is good and bad at the same time. Good because it stimulates entrepreneurship, but bad because it can ruin your financial stability. That's why it is so important to build a consistent and specialized career, so you have a target audience and a network to rely on for fast relocation.

Despite the very short experience in IoT, I intend to stick with it in the long run. I'm so excited that I already bought [Arduino] and [RaspberryPI] kits, put them to work, and started learning languages like Go, Rust and C to put aside all limitations of high level languages.
