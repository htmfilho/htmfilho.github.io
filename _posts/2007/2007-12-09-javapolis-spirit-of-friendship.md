Yesterday I was surprised about what I saw in the Javapolis homepage. Stephan, the Javapolis chairman, <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/" target="_blank">published my picture there</a>! Actually, I’m a simple guy, a little bit shy and I don’t want to become famous, but it is very cool for me and totally unexpected.

What I would like to say is that Javapolis is not yet another Java conference. It is a moment for friendship, where people are more important than technologies. Where everybody is simple, even our Java superstars.

I don’t have doubts that it is a positive Java User Group influence. I remember in the last <a href="http://www.jazoon.com/" target="_blank">Jazoon</a> conference, when <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/felipegaucho/" target="_blank">Felipe Gaúcho</a> started to promote the community through the official web blog. The conference became more soft, more people oriented, less technical, less corporative. I also appeared there thanks to my friendship with Gaúcho. Javapolis is a little better in this aspect: we became friends by e-mail, in one or two messages, in one or two days.

Javapolis will be great because there exists an excellent team promoting it and because everyone will do the same spontaneously.
