I used to work as a development team leader at Universit√© catholique de Louvain.
In Belgium, universities are not public, but they are largely subsidized by the
government, proportionally to the number of students. Because of that, it works
like a public institution. There, employees have great work stability and
benefits, but to have a better salary they only have three posibilities: have a
better education, work for years to reach seniority or be promoted. In my case,
I was happy with my salary because I have good education and seniority. I had no
intention to be promoted in the sence of going up in the hierarchy because I was
really happy working
