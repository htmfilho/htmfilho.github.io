title: "Did Oracle Regret about Kenai Ultimatum?"

All Kenai Project Leaders received a message from Oracle trying to explain a possible misunderstanding about the message they transmitted before. From my understanding there is no misunderstanding, but a change of plans due to the community reaction. Take a look at the open letter below:

> Gentlepeople,

> In an effort to get information out to the Kenai community quickly, while trying to manage the integration of our two companies, I think we did a poor job at communicating our plans for Kenai.com to you. I would like to remedy that now. Our strategy is simple. We don’t believe it makes sense to continue investing in multiple hosted development sites that are basically doing the same thing. Our plan is to shut down kenai.com and focus our efforts on java.net as the hosted development community. We are in the process of migrating java.net to the kenai technology. This means that any project currently hosted on kenai.com will be able to continue as you are on java.net. We are still working out the technical details, but the goal is to make this migration as seamless as possible for the current kenai.com projects. So in the meantime I suggest that you stay put on kenai.com and let us work through the details and get back to you later this month.

That’s pretty good! It is the first signal that Oracle is willing to listen to the community. I’m happy with that because it was a constructive decision, good for both sides. However, a question remains: Will current java.net projects migrate to Kenai infrastructure or will Kenai projects migrate to java.net infrastructure? I’m asking that because the Kenai infrastructure is far better. A migration to java.net infrastructure is actually a downgrade.

It seems we have to wait until the end of February to finally get an answer. I can’t wait for that!
