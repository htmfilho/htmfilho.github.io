Letâ€™s consider that you have to create a website with a dynamic presentation and you own a technology specially made for this purpose. Strangely, you do not use your own technology to make the presentation, but the technology offered by a competitor. Is it a recognition that your own technology sucks? Is there any other explanation?

Fact: following a link shared by a friend, Iâ€™ve reached an Oracle/Sun University [sub-site](http://content.yudu.com/A1h149/BRTG/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=) that gives detailed information about the new Java Certification Program. This website was made 100% in Flash, an Adobeâ€™s technology. You may know that Oracle/Sun created a technology called [JavaFx](http://javafx.com/) to compete directly with Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight on the rich client market. So, why donâ€™t they use JavaFx instead?

Making a gross comparison, Oracleâ€™s choice for Flash is like Steve Jobs, Appleâ€™s CEO, using Power Point instead of Keynote to prepare his great presentations. Or Steve Ballmer, Microsoftâ€™s CEO, using MacOS instead of Windows (Itâ€™s possible by the way). Can you imagine Nokiaâ€™s CEO using an iPhone? Google employees using Bing? No. But you can see JavaFxâ€™s owner using Flash. It is indeed a great recognition for Adobe, which was endorsed by a competitor as the best technology to present their products.

How would the JavaFx development community, who embraced the technology, feel? If the owner doesnâ€™t fully embrace it, why would they do it? Maybe Iâ€™m not exploring the web enough, but I havenâ€™t seen any website using JavaFx so far (I mean, without Sunâ€™s sponsorship). I donâ€™t know where the developers of the JavaFx technology can find motivation to keep working on its evolution. It has become a playground thing that people use to create demos and silly games.

Taking into consideration all benefits that HTML5 will bring in a near future, who will still consider the adoption of JavaFx in a long term perspective? This is probably the everlasting presentation language of the future. ðŸ˜€
