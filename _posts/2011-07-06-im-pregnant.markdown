Today, my wife gave me the greatest news I’ve ever received. She said that I’m gonna be a DAD! Uhuu! o/ This is something very powerful, you know?! I have no words to describe my expectation to become a father. The news has an immediate impact on the way we see life from now on. All plans we made for ourselves in the coming days, months, years, are now totally forgotten. This new life has the power of attracting all our attention and dedication, which makes me think that the future cannot be designed, at least for the next nine months, and everything that will happen is unpredictable and deserves immediate response.

You may wonder why the title is “I’m pregnant” if I’m obviously a man. It is because I’m feeling all symptoms of a pregnancy that my wife is going through. Of course my Love is reading lots of books, websites and magazines about her new experience. As she tells me what she is feeling, I get myself feeling the same! 😀 hehehe Nausea, fatigue, headaches, frequent urination, and everything else she tells me. I’m also following the same diet and habits. The absence of coffee is the worse part. I was used to drink 3 to 4 cups a day, which makes me realize now that I was addicted to it. I’m probably getting some weight too, but I certainly need self control about food because one big belly is enough for a pregnant couple.

By the way, a baby is not the only good news. The package also includes 9 months (maybe more) without premenstrual irritation, menstruation, birth control, tampons, and no worries about keeping a flat tummy 😉

This boy or girl will probably have some time in the future to visit this post. So, I’m getting the opportunity to say a few words:

> “<i>We will do our best to educate you the most constructive and positive way possible. It includes doing things that you won’t like at the moment you experience it, but you will understand when you grow up. You have to understand that you are our first experience as parents and we will probably make some mistakes in the course of your education. We never know.</i>


> <i>We plan to have another baby, maybe a third one also, because we believe that it’s important for you to have a brother or sister. When we are all growing together as a family, don’t worry when you notice that we are giving more attention for them than for you. This is because they are younger and naturally deserve more attention, as you received when you were at the same age. We also understand that you are more mature to understand that. At some point none of you will have privileges any more and we will treat you all equally, as we love you all equally. </i>


> <i>Another point is concerning the language we speak with you. At home you will listen to Portuguese. At the day care center you will listen to French. Furthermore, since you were born in Belgium, which has three official languages, the language confusion will get even worse :D. But it is good for you. We decided to speak in Portuguese with you because we think you should speak fluently with other members of the family, like your grandparents, uncles, cousins, aunts and so on. They are really nice people and they were all waiting for you too. I wished you could see their faces when your mother told them you were coming. </i>


> <i>By the way, your mother is feeling great now! She is reading a lot of books that try to explain how to take care of you. We know they are not always right and the real thing will start when you show up here 🙂 God! You have no idea how life already changed so far. Good changes of course. We have nothing to complain about. Just waiting for you now.</i>“
