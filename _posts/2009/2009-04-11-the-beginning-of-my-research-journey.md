The <a href="http://luqs.unifor.br/luqs">Laboratory of Studies on the Use and Quality of Systems</a> (LUQS), at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/luqs.unifor.br/luqs">University of Fortaleza</a> (UNIFOR), is celebrating 10 years in 2009. LUQS was the first computer science lab of the university and I was part of the research team in 2001, which is called today the first generation of young researchers. The picture below shows the initial team and how united we were.

<div>In this picture, I’m the one on the right with a blue shirt, a big smile and a young face of 22 years old. The head of the lab since its foundation is Elizabeth Furtado, right in the center of the picture, with a pink shirt, a long black hair and well protected by two big guys.</div>

<div>I started my academic life in that room with all those people. I was initially a volunteer, working during my free time between undergraduate classes. The kinds of computational problems that I faced there were so challenging and exciting that I decided to quit my job in a <a href="http://www.ivia.com.br/">software company</a> after two years of well paid work. My experience with research improved my reasoning capabilities and taught me a very important lesson: </div>

</div>
<div>Since that time, I never say “no” to an interesting research challenge.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Besides that, the University of Fortaleza has quite a good research environment, with a very large garden and fresh air even under 35° degree of a permanent summer.</div
