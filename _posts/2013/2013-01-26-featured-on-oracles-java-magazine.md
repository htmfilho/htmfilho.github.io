Iâ€™m glad to see I was featured on the latest edition of [Oracleâ€™s Java Magazine](http://oracle.com/javamagazine) (Issue January/February 2013, page 67). I would like to thank [Oracle](http://oracle.com/) on behalf of the [CEJUG Community](http://cejug.org/). We have been partners for so long and this is a nice way to demonstrate that you guys, at Oracle, recogniseÂ our contribution to the Java Community.

Itâ€™s important to say that they cut part of my hair using Photoshop. Iâ€™m actually more handsome than it looks likeâ€¦ hehehehe ðŸ˜€ Joking! Back to work!
