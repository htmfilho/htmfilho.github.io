Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the result of a reaction in which a hydrocarbon (an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon like most of fuels) reacts with oxygen to produce CO2 and water. Unfortunately, you cannot see or feel this gas because it's colorless and odorless but you can be sure of its presence when you watch a candle burn or you exhale after inhale.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is the result of a reaction in which a hydrocarbon also reacts with oxygen but in an environment with a limited supply of air, resulting in less oxygen in the molecule. Because of the abundance of oxygen in the air, CO doesn't occur naturally in the atmosphere, but industrialized equipment, that we can find at our home or office, can produce high levels of this gas. Fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, stoves, dryers, water heaters, fireplaces, and cars are well known emitters of this colorless and odorless gas that can only be detected with special sensors.

Both gases are dangerous for human beings but the lethal concentration varies. CO2 poisoning is rare because it requires a high concentration of it in a confined space, leading to symptoms like headaches and dizziness before the feeling of suffocation, which triggers the search for fresh air. On the other hand, CO is far more dangerous. It attaches to blood cells and prevents the distribution of oxygen throughout the body, causing a silent and painless lethal intoxication.

The best way to prevent gas intoxication is to ensure air circulation in the area. It can be done by simply opening the window, the door, or turning on the exhaust fan. But when it is not convenient to do, due to extreme weather conditions outside or the design of the building or the presence of a high emitter of those gases in the room, then it is crucial to consider installing a sensor.

Each gas requires its own sensor.
