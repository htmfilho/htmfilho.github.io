With all those crazy things going on all around the world these days, I believe sharing good news may help to compensate with good vibes all the negativity out there. **Itâ€™s a good thing to recognize good actions made by people around us**.

Having said that, I devote this post to send a big thanks to [Frankfurt Airport](http://www.frankfurt-airport.com/) and to [Lufthansa Airlines](http://www.lufthansa.com/). I donâ€™t know how these companies are evaluated by their customers in general. Perhaps, we were simply lucky, but what has happened and the way we were treated are worth spreading.

We arrived at Frankfurt Airport in an [United Airlines](https://www.united.com/)Â flightÂ coming from the US (I have nothing to say about this company btw :-/). We were three: My wife, my one year old boy and I. The airport isÂ enormous, but it couldnâ€™t be easier to get directions inside. We experienced good accessibility carrying our babyâ€™s stroller, with a negligible delay in comparison to other ways.

Everybody was genuinely gentle, from theÂ immigration to the arrival in Brussels. No silly jokes, no excessive friendly behavior, just fine ðŸ™‚ That was the first contact we had with those people, thus they have no reason to exceed kindness, unless they were selling a false image of the company, which they didnâ€™t. We actually felt relaxed dealing with those people. We needed that after a exhausting 8 hours flight from the US.

Our baby arrived at the airport sleeping and stayed like that until Brussels. Thatâ€™s what I call the smoothest flight connection ever ðŸ™‚ The baby spaces are separated from the toilets and they are accessible within a range of 50 meters maximum. The security check has a special track for people with strollers andÂ wheel chairs. We followed the procedureÂ calmly and fast ðŸ™‚Â Â All that is soÂ convenient!

Even things that rarely work were working that day ðŸ™‚ We didnâ€™t have our seats marked in the flight to Brussels due to some technical problems during the reservation. We were afraid to have seats far from each other and be forced toÂ negotiateÂ rearrangementsÂ within the airplane.Â Fortunately, the attendant managed to put us together. It never happened before! I mayÂ admit we were lucky ðŸ˜‰

It couldnâ€™t be better until the boarding time when our expectations were exceeded! A lot of first and business class peopleÂ around and the attendant called us to be the first ones to enter in the airplane. She called us out loud using the microphone and explained to other passengers that the baby would require some extra effort during boarding and it would help to gain some time after all. I call it intelligence and good judgmentÂ because thatâ€™s exactly what I would do in her shoes ðŸ™‚

Unfortunately, many airports out there banned such practice, which is the case of [Brussels Airport](http://www.brusselsairport.be/)Â and [Washington Dulles](http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/dulles.htm), the ones we have been with our baby. **Those airports following such stupid rule should give attention to families with babies and people withÂ disabilities because this is not a privilege to a minority, but aÂ necessity**. They ignore the fact that itâ€™sÂ tough to travel with a little baby. Thanks to Lufthansa, we arrived very relaxed in Belgium, with a big smile on our faces ðŸ™‚.
