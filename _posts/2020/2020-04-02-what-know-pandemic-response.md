This is a compilation of what I know so far about the pandemic that is in course. I started writing this post in April 2nd and I keep contributing with content as I learn more about the situation. My goal is to compile knowledge today to be used some time in the future in case a pandemic crisis happens again.

## Tests

The reason why tests are so important is because it allows preparation to what is yet to come. In the case of COVID-19, it is known that 80% of people go through with mild symptoms, 20% need some level of hospitalization, 5% need intensive care, and 2% die. By knowing how many people are sick, we take these percentages of the total, prepare the hospitals for the volume of new patients over time and we also alert the suply chain about the iminent demand. The sooner the tests happen the better because it buys time. The lack of preparation leads to overloaded hospitals, contamination of existing patients, contamination of health professionals, who have to stop working until being tested negative again, among other chaotic situations.

## Economy

The USA [sent 22 cargo airplanes to China to get as much medical suppriment as they could][22-airplanes]. While they were loading their airplanes they realized another airplane with suppriments was ready to take off to France. The [US buyers offered three times what their French counterparts were paying][france-lost]. That's one of many attitudes worldwide that may end what is known as global markets, at least for essencial items. The global suply chain is congested, governments are compiling lists of what they consider essencial and investing in industries willing to reconfigure their production lines to attend the urgent demand. Countries are by their own, differentiated by their criative potential to invent solutions under pressure.

The economy paused for a while to minimize the spread of the virus. Millions of non-essencial business were forced to close. As a consequence, millions of people lost their jobs and depend on government's assistance to put food on the table. Those who preserved their jobs work for essencial businesses or are backed by financially healthy companies. Ironically, some businesses such as supermarkets, industries of essencial items, farmacies, are actually hiring more people. On the other hand, turism, transport, restaurants and others are in deep crisis.

A lot of people without income are facing the hard choice of paying their bills or putting food on the table. Before the crises the situation was already concerning. [Over half (53%) of Canadians were living paycheque to paycheque and one in four (25%) say their debt load is overwhelming. More than one-quarter (27%) don’t have enough for their daily needs][affordability-index]. Imagine what these people are facing during this crisis. It may trigger a behavioral change where people may reevaluate their consumption habits in favor of short and long term savings.

That's a work in progress. I make contributions every day as I learn more about these hard times.
