Recently, I was involved in an European research project and I had to prepare and present a sustainable business plan for a set of open source products, produced during this project. The presentation was very good and the feedback too, but I can’t give more details here. What I can say is that the meeting was hosted in a Belgian company located in Mons, very well structured and with an excellent support for the main beverage of the country: Beer. You can see below some pictures, not so good, but still visible.

I just admire a company that offers an infra-structure like this for their employees.

I am not with the best sense of humor to publish a post like this one. Don’t take it as a joke, but it was written in recognition to the “why not?” thought of the company. Congratulations!
