## Programming Languages

I've been a programmer on the market since 1998, when I was hired by an internet
company, called Infovia (nowadays, IVIA), to develop web applications. My first
applications were developed in Microsoft Visual Basic, ASP (Active Server
Pages), and Lotus Domino/Notes, but I soon reoriented my career to Java,
sticking to it from 2001 to 2015. After 2015, I have diversified my programming
experience to Python and Go, for productivity purpouses, and Clojure and Elixir
to master the functional paradigm.
