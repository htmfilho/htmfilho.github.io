![The seven sins](/images/posts/seven-sins.jpg)

This is customer perspective of over 8 years dealing with several consultants hired to help on the projects I was directly involved. This is also a remind to myself so I don't make the same mistakes if I decide to become a consultant some day.

According to [Wikipedia][wikipedia-consultant]:

> "A consultant is a professional who provides expert advice in a specialized field. (...) By hiring a consultant, clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be financially feasible for them to retain in-house on a long-term basis. (...) Clients can control their expenditures on consulting services by only purchasing as much services from the outside consultant as desired."

In summary, consultants are specialized and expensive. Therefore, the 7 deadly sins listed below are related to behavioral and economical aspects, easily preventable or forgivable by following common sense.

## Pride: Do Explicit Demonstrations of Self-Promotion

As a consultant, it is expected that you spend some time selling your skills. It is normal to talk about them with some pride, but it is not normal when you keep talking about your greatness without being asked or outside of a negotiation talk. Expectations about what you have to deliver may increase substantially to the point you have to double your effort to satisfy the customer. Your peers will make fun of you in the event of your first failure. Afterwards, you will have problems to gather recommendations from them.

On the other hand, if you show humility, listening and acting more than talking, you will certainly win respect from your peers. This ability shows you are there to help by focusing on the task at hand, instead of on yourself.

## Envy: Teach Good Practices and Behave in the Opposite Way

Being Envy is the desire to have a quality belonging to someone else. You know the quality well, you are able to explain it to other people, but for some reason you don't have what it takes to possess this quality. You may do it once or twice, but you don't have the discipline to pursuit the habit.

What happens with some consultants, when inquired by customers, is that they talk about good practices in a confident way without ever experiencing them. They explain those practices to the team, probably after following some tutorial, the team absorbes the practices and then

## Wrath: Ignore The Context of the Organization
