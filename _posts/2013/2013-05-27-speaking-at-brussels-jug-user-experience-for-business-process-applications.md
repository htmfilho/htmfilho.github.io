I’m glad to inform that I will speak at the next [Brussels JUG‘s](http://www.brussels-jug.be/) event about user experience thinking and design for business process applications. The event will take place at [Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel](http://www.hubkaho.be/), Building Hermes, on Thursday, 30th of May, at 6:30 pm. Visit Brussels JUG website for more information: [http://www.brussels-jug.be](http://www.brussels-jug.be/).

You won’t find a lot of information about this subject on this blog, but I have been doing research about it in parallel since 2006, in collaboration with [Kênia Sousa](http://www.linkedin.com/in/keniasousa), who would be happy to share the stage, but she had to decline due to family duties.

If you were assigned to design and implement a business process based application, You may find this session interesting. User interface design is the most time consuming task in a software development process. It is highly subjective and under heavy criticism by end-users. This presentation will help you better deal with this problem, exploring strategies to represent business processes in a way that end-users can easily understand what they see based on their business knowledge. We will discuss about a different approach for Business-IT traceability based on UX, an architecture and a methodology to support constant process changes, navigation approaches and the right widgets for the right actions.

See you there!
