This is customer perspective of over 8 years dealing with several consultants hired to help on the projects I was directly involved. This is also a remind to myself so I don't make the same mistakes if I decide to become a consultant some day.

According to [Wikipedia][wikipedia-consultant]:

> "A consultant is a professional who provides expert advice in a specialized field. (...) By hiring a consultant, clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be financially feasible for them to retain in-house on a long-term basis. (...) Clients can control their expenditures on consulting services by only purchasing as much services from the outside consultant as desired."

In summary, consultants are specialized and expensive. Therefore, the 7 deadly sins listed below are related to behavioral and economical aspects, easily preventable or forgivable by following common sense.

## Pride: Do Explicit Demonstrations of Self-Promotion

You can always do it on the mirror, but it is very hard to do it in front of other people without sounding snobbish. From the moment people think you are snobbish, they will question you more frequently and you will have a hard time to convince them.

## Envy: Teach Good Practices and Behave in the Opposite Way
