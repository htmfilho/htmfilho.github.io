Iâ€™m glad to see I was featured on the latest edition of <a href="http://oracle.com/javamagazine" target="_blank">Oracleâ€™s Java Magazine</a> (Issue January/February 2013, page 67). I would like to thank <a href="http://oracle.com/" target="_blank">Oracle</a> on behalf of the <a href="http://cejug.org/" target="_blank">CEJUG Community</a>. We have been partners for so long and this is a nice way to demonstrate that you guys, at Oracle, recogniseÂ our contribution to the Java Community.

Itâ€™s important to say that they cut part of my hair using Photoshop. Iâ€™m actually more handsome than it looks likeâ€¦ hehehehe ðŸ˜€ Joking! Back to work!
