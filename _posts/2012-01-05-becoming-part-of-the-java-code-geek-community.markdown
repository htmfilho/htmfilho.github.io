I’m glad to announce that I just became part of the <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/" target="_blank">Java Code Geeks</a> (JCG) community! I have been following this community for a long time, consuming a lot of great Java articles, and now I’m part of it. This is a great honor and also a great responsibility because it is a way of pushing myself to write betters articles and do it in a more frequent way.

For those who don’t know JCG, this is a community of bloggers whose articles are of interest to the Java developer community. They simplify the process of publishing selected blog articles by JCG members on a aggregator website.  This is a win-win game because JCGs enjoy substantially increased visibility and the audience enjoys great content.<br/>I also had the opportunity to include <a href="http://www.cejug.org/" target="_blank">CEJUG</a> as a supporting user group. In the coming days I will find time to integrate JCG’s posts with CEJUG’s website using rss and let people know how I did it here.
