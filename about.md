My name is Hildeberto Mendonça and I'm currently managing a team of programmers
on the development of core business applications for the [Université catholique
de Louvain](http://www.uclouvain.be). I'm also busy with the architecture of the
systems, coaching the team in Java, Python, object-oriented and functional
programming, as well as planning releases and shipping them.

I have acumulated experience on software architecture since 2010 with constant
programming hands on to master the principles and practices of software
development in order to offer technical value for the team. Sometimes, I do not
hesitate to fullfil the role of programmer whenever the team needs a hand.

I have a Ph.D in applied sciences on the field of electrical enginnering. I took
this degree as a challenge, which I achieved with great honor, but I've decided
to follow a different path to pursuite my passion for programming. The reason
was simple: research has a long time to market circle and I wanted to solve real
world problems in a daily basis, feel myself useful as frequently as possible.
But research gave me three habilities that I'm pround of:

1. **resilience** - I don't quit, I have no fear, I do not hesitate. My Ph.D was
   one of the hardest think I ever did. Everything else seems easy to deal with,
   which explains my permanent state of optimism.
2. **reading and writing** - I've read and wrote so much that I feel imense
   pleasure during my reading and writing sessions. By the way, I strongly
   disagree with a statement in the agile manifesto that says: "_Working
   software over comprehensive documentation_". You don't use any library
   without documentation, do you?
3. **problem solving oriented** - problems are what keep me motivated. When
   solutions come, and they always come, I fullfil my need of being usefull
   for others. Part of the solution for every problem is to contagiate our pears
   to feel the same.

At last, but not least, I love swimming! That's my sport, the one that I spent
years practicing when I was a kid and changed my life recently, when I decided
to resume it after 20 years, leaving behind a sedentary life weighing 103kg to a
healthier and stronger one with 15kg less. So, next time you ask me "_How
are you doing?_" and I tell you "_Everything is great!_" you will know I'm
telling you the truth, no matter the circunstancies.
