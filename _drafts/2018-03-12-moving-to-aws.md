I current host this website on GitHub Pages. Its content is publicly available, but not its source because I have a lot of versioned drafts I don't want you to read before they are finished. So, there are managed in a private repository. To have private repositories, I have to pay 7 USD per month to GitHub. I have been paying this 7 bucks since June 2017, which makes, at the present day, a total of $70. Two more months and I'm going to pay $84 for a year of hosting. This is good compared to my previous hosting Before, I was paying [$200][welcome-to-jekyll]/yr to host a Wordpress blog. 

    $ sudo apt-get install git
