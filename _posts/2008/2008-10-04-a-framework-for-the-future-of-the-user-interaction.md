If you follow my blog, you may know about my interest on the extreme usability era (<a href="http://planexstrategy.blogspot.com/2008/08/extreme-usability-era.html">1</a>, <a href="http://planexstrategy.blogspot.com/2008/09/more-examples-of-extreme-usability.html">2</a>). You may also know that this interest was born during the <a href="http://planexstrategy.blogspot.com/2008/08/enterface08-workshop-finished.html">eNTERFACE workshop in Paris</a>. So, this interest has been growing every day in an intense manner that made me choose this subject as the theme of my PhD research project at <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/">UCL</a>. More: I decided to start an open source project, first to share my knowledge and second, to get contributions from the community.

The project was published at: <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/meanings4fusion">http://kenai.com/projects/meanings4fusion</a>. It is hosted by the project <a href="http://www.kenai.com/">Kenai</a>, a <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a> initiative to support open source projects. I’ve just registered the project this morning, so you will not find so much information there. However, if you believe that extreme usability is a reality and it will directly affect you in a short-term, then I recommend to get involved from now on and participate on all discussions and initial implementations.

I’m not doing it alone, of course. <a href="http://enterface08.limsi.fr/participant/gomez">David Gómez</a>, <a href="http://enterface08.limsi.fr/participant/neiberg">Daniel Neiberg</a>, <a href="http://enterface08.limsi.fr/participant/vybornova">Olga Vybornova</a> and <a href="http://enterface08.limsi.fr/participant/shen">Ao Shen</a> are also involved and they are founders too. Actually, we started everything during eNTERFACE and it is a continuation for consolidation. This is a challenging project and we really worked hard, as you can see in the picture below.
