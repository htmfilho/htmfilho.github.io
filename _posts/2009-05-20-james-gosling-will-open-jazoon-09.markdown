I won’t be able to attend Jazoon’09 this <a href="http://jazoon.com/en.html">time</a>. Instead, I’m going to present a research paper in a <a href="http://www.specom.nw.ru/specom_e.html">conference held in Saint Petersburg, Russia</a>. You know, I’m a researcher at this moment and this kind of conference has more priority for me. I’ve attended <a href="http://jazoon.com/jazoon07/en.html">Jazoon’07</a> and <a href="http://jazoon.com/jazoon08/en.html">Jazoon’08</a> and I do recommend Jazoon’09 for you. In 2008 I even gave a talk there, representing my <a href="http://www.cejug.org/">Java User Group</a>, which was indeed a great moment for me.

Zurich is great, the weather is perfect and people are nice. You’re gonna have fun there, for sure. I feel bad for not going this year because I miss <a href="http://jazoon.com/en/sponsorsandpartners/producer.html">Christian Frey</a>, Jazoon’s General Manager, who is a great person. He is that kind of person who is really committed to make everything perfect for you even with all difficulties. I also miss my dear friend <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/felipegaucho/">Felipe Gaúcho</a>, who is a great Java professional working in Zurich, Switzerland. You will find him at Jazoon for sure, drinking a lot of beers. Btw, the beer is for free there ;).

This year James Gosling, the creator of the Java language, will be the opening-keynote speaker of the conference. I’ve met James in the last edition of <a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/?p=183">JavaPolis in 2007</a> (Now it is <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/">Devoxx</a>). It’s really nice to shake his hand, say hello, listen to his voice and take <a href="http://69.89.31.239/~hildeber/?p=180">some pictures</a>. Don’t miss the opportunity to meet the guy who created the language that gave you a great job!
