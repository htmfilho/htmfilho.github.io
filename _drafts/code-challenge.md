The advantage of HackerRank is that the whole code is shown, including how the
inputs are given. Unfortunately, we don't see the code of the tests, only
inputs and outputs. Codewars, on the other hand, gives only the function to be
developed and all the rest is hidden, but at least we can see some basic tests.
The presence of the tests passes a good message to developers, showing they
must exist before the code is implemented. In addition, Codewars usability is
better because the instructions, the coding area and the tests are shown in the
same screen without scrolling. In HackerRank, we have to scroll up and down all
the time, which is time consuming.
