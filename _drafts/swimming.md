I came back from a 10 days vacation in Brazil with 103kg, in August 2016. A month later, returning to the European diet and getting rid of all the water retained in my body due to the salty Brazilian food. I've reached 101kg. For my height, I was clearly obese, feeling uncomfortable with my daily life. Everything was more difficult to do, I was feeling unnaturally lazy, unmotivated, heavy. It made me constantly think about going back to the gym, but I was tired of paying for it in the past without actually going. I thought about buying a treadmill or an exercise bike, but after a while, I know they would become part of the decoration. I also thought if I wanted to engage in something then it would need to become a habit or part of my daily routine. I thought about going to work by bike or walking but it rains a lot here in Belgium, which would break my routine.

I was out of practical options when I finally thought: what if I go back to swimming? I've used to swim a lot when I was a kid. I'm not sure when I started but I do know when I finished. It was exactly 20 years ago, when I was 17 and studding hard for the college admission exams. I also remember why I've started. My family had a farm with a swimming pool. I regularly invited some friends from school to swim with me. Since I had that pool to play every weekend, I was indeed the fastest one among my friends. Until one of them, known as Gilmar, started a swimming course to help with his respiratory issues. In a matter of months Gilmar was beating me in my own pool. That took me totally by surprise. So, a week later I enrolled to the same swimming course.

Almost instinctively, I tried to rank myself in the group. It was frustrating to know I was only the third one, after Gilmar and Galileu. That's a lot of work to do because Galileu was one of those kids that was good in almost every discipline. He was in the soccer team, volleyball team, best bike rider, best marble player and it goes on and on. In the swimming pool he was in second because it was really hard to beat Gilmar, a tall and strong kid with remarkable determination. But I was obsessed to beat anyone who threatened me in my own swimming pool.

It didn't take too long to beat Galileu. A couple of months later I was already chasing Gilmar, but I actually had to get used to the second place for a long time. The obsession had dissolved and I started to relax and enjoy swimming as a passion.

At the age of 15, the destine of most kids is wealthy conditions, like myself, was to continue the studies in a bigger city, with better schools. But before leaving, pushed by family traditions, I had to confirm I was a real catholic in a ceremony known as Crisma. Not a big deal, but these ceremonies usually requires some preparation that I wasn't happy to engage because, coincidently, it was happening in the last week of preparation for my last competition in my hometown. I had to completely stop training while the other kids were doing their best. Up to a certain point, I simply accepted my fate of a mere and discreet participation.
