I almost never believe in predictions unless they match my owns. Only the future can prove them right or wrong, but I was astonished when I read this excerpt from the book _[The Demon-Haunted World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World)_ by [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan). It literally summarizes what the World became in recent years.
