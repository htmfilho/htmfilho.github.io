## The Author

My name is Hildeberto Mendonca, father of two amazing kids and husband of a wonderful woman. I'm a proactive, result-driven, disciplined professional with 18+ years experience in the IT industry. Across a variety of roles, I provide value through my skills in programming, software design, architecture, training and team empowerment. I'm a highly flexible professional, in [permanent state of learning][projects], and driven towards delivering quality results.

I have a Ph.D. in applied sciences on the field of electrical engineering. I took this degree as a challenge, which I achieved with great honor, but I've decided to follow a different path to pursuit my passion for software engineering. The reason was simple: research has a long Time to Market cycle and I wanted to solve real world problems incrementally, feeling myself useful as frequently as possible. Anyway, my time as a scientist gave me three abilities that I'm proud of:

1. **Resilience** - I don't quit, I have no fear, I do not hesitate. My Ph.D was one of the hardest things I ever did. Everything else seems easy to deal with, which explains my permanent state of optimism.

2. **Reading and Writing** - I've read and wrote so much that I feel immense pleasure during my reading and writing sessions. By the way, I strongly disagree with a statement in the agile manifesto that says: "_Working software over comprehensive documentation_". All libraries and frameworks you use in your applications are heavily documented. Why wouldn't your applications be too?

3. **Problem Solving Oriented** - problems keep me motivated. When solutions come, and they always come, I fulfill my need of being useful for others. Part of the solution for every problem is to influence our peers to feel the same.

### Permanent Goals

Inspired by the book [Deep Work](/books/2017/10/deep-work.html), here are my permanent goals:

#### Personal Goals

1. Keep family in harmony by taking actions to improve union, resilience and health.
2. Educate kids intellectually, physically, economically and with humanitarian values.
3. Run an organized, simplified, and cost-efficient household.

#### Professional Goals

1. Craft well-written and organized programs that serves their purpose for a long time.
2. Make sure the organization has enough information about my work so they don't become dependent on me.
3. Be well informed and educated to make the best technical decisions for every business context.
4. Be kind, professional, honest, and positive with everybody in the office.

### Values

- Loyalty

- Duty

- Respect

- Selfless Service

- Honor

- Integrity

- Personal Courage

## The Blog

In this blog I write about personal experiences and software engineering. I've been doing this since 2007.

<canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018'],
        datasets: [{

            data: [8, 34, 42, 29, 8, 9, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 12],
            backgroundColor: [

                ticks: {
                    beginAtZero: true
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});

After 10 years maintaining this blog, I can confirm my love for writing is consolidated. It is also spreading. For instance, it wasn't the case before, but now I confidently believe that [every software must have an up to date documentation](/2018/01/rethinking-software-documentation.html). I try to write in front of my kids in order to influence them and I already noticed them trying to mimic their father. I also pushed my wife to revive her blog and now I'm afraid she will become more active than me overtime.

I love to write but it doesn't mean I'm happy with it. I have been shooting in all directions so far and I think it's time to focus. So, I've decided to direct my thoughts to help IT professionals to improve their technical writing skills. I talk about practices, tools and techniques, even programming to increase writing productivity. Overtime, it will eventually become more opinionated, but I hope to keep pushing you to write more, not less.
