Is it time to rethink how we develop user interfaces nowadays? The video below proves that it is. It shows why user interfaces must respect natural abilities of human beings instead of humans being adapted to operate machines.

Instead of expecting a new clever generation of computer users willing to operate machines through buttons and clicks, we have to change the technology to keep the humanity so natural as they were born to be.
