This is the IDE that I have been using uninterruptedly since version 6.0, when I left <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> behind, after 5 years on it. Today Iâ€™m very happy with the version 6.1, and I know I will be even happier with the new next version, 6.5, which is coming out on the following days.

This is the list of posts Iâ€™ve written about Netbeans. I would like to invite you to revisit those posts if you donâ€™t mind. It was a love and hate story, with more love than hate ðŸ˜‰ :

Because of one of these posts, the Netbeans project sent to me a nice t-shirt that fit me very well. Take a look below.

I hope to celebrate this anniversary drinking some beers with the Netbeans Dream Team during the <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/">Devoxx Conference</a>, in December.
