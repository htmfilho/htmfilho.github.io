This week I attended, once again, the <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/">Devoxx</a> Conference in Antwerp, Belgium. This time I had the opportunity to give a talk there about a <a href="http://www.usi4biz.com/">software project</a> that Iâ€™m working on. Of course, it was a greeeat experience! I have to say that this one was the most professional infra-structure I ever had to give a talk. Amazing! So, congratulations for the whole Devoxxâ€™09 team including organizers, technicians, assistants and others who made our sessions soÂ comfortable, professional and attractive (yeah, I also had my biggest audience ðŸ˜‰ ).

The subject of the talk is not in the scope of this blog, but you can learn more about it in another blog that I contribute to. Here, Iâ€™m going to share only the nicest picture of myself in conferences. ðŸ˜€ hehehe. Many thanks for the professional photographer there.
