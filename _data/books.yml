- title: Functional thinking
  author: Neal Ford
  description: As a backend engineer, it is important for me to deal with
    concurrency, paralelism, and the usage of resources. These subjects are so
    complex that they forced functional programming to lift from its grave.
    Shifting from object-oriented to functional is a challenge for a mind that
    has been strugling with objects, design patterns and good practices since
    2002. Dispite having some practice programming in Clojure, a functional
    language, I hope to consolidate my knowledge starting from this book, which
    shows that the main challenge to master a functional language is not the
    syntax, but the paradigm.
