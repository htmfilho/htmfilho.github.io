After decades of software development, we realized that data is more valuable than software. An application is more likely to be rewritten in a modern technology and continue pointing to an existing database than an existing application be modified to access data from a different database. Of course both cases exist, but applications tend to become more chaotic than databases over time.

 - applications are more frequently changed than databases.
 - it is hard to migrate large volumes of data from a database to another without major issues.
