# Amazon Web Services - Interview Preparation

## Process

## Introduction

## Behavioral

### Motivation

> As a prospective employee, I see the meaning, the obsession of solving customers' problems with inventive solutions. The idea of moving to Canada brought back the dream of opening a company, as I did in the past, but I consider working at AWS as a fulfillment of this dream because I have the feeling that we, as a team, will work together like in a start-up. Putting in practice our ownership, inventiveness and highest standards in benefit of our customers.

### Leadership Principles

#### Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

* Proactive thinking about customers needs.
* Work vigorously to earn and keep customer's trust.
* Start with the customer and work backwards.

1. Customer obsession is treating everybody and everything as a customer. This is the only way to embed it our bones.

2. As a software architect and team leader, I have the privilege to be constantly in contact with users (customers). My main concern when talking to them is to make sure they understand all the technicalities behind their needs. To give you an example: The head of the infra-structure unit was explaining our recently private cloud deployment to business users and I noticed they were struggling to understand the idea of "cloud". I had the impression they thought cloud was a social network thing. So, I asked for permission to make an analogy. So told them an story when I was stuck with my car in the snow...

#### Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job".

1. Recently, I took ownership of an application that needed maintenance. My boss was under pressure to allocate resources, but according to her we were all busy. When I found some free time, I went there, fixed some bugs, added new features, and documented everything I learned. My boss approached me later telling the users were not making pressure anymore and there was no more reason hurry. Then I explained to her that I was actually working on the backlog of the application myself and this is probably the reason why things got calm over time. She later thanked me for taking out the issue from her shoulders, but I was not worried about her shoulders when I decided to take action.

#### Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited  by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

1. My tangible definition of innovation is to

2.

3. Clojure, Go, Elixir

#### Are Right, A Lot

* Listen a lot
* Change the mind a lot
* Seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm own believes (Give the example of functional decomposition)
* Strong judgment and good instincts.

#### Learn and Be Curious
#### Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

1. I'm extremely happy to have interviewed and recommended the hiring of three of the best professionals I have in the team. I have been empowering them over the years and now I'm relaxed to go without leaving any knowledge gap or fear of taking risks. I'm sure they are going to fulfill the space I've left. I recommended by boss to promote them instead of hiring a new person for the role.

2. I have been conducting weekly one-hour knowledge sharing sessions, where people are pushed to share what they have learned recently. We have a Safari Books subscription and we follow some video trainings together.

#### Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

1. We have reached 1 thousands unit tests last month, with 97% coverage on new code and 71% overall.

2. We use Sentry to be notified of bad user experiences at the moment they happen and we act to solve them within two yours maximum.

3. We use Travis and CodeClimate to make sure the applications are always in a runnable state and all quality indicators are going on the good direction.

4. We have screens in common spaces showing real time data about the execution of the project and the applications' health to make our commitment to quality is as transparent as possible.

#### Think Big
#### Bias for Action
#### Frugality

This is the second time we are going to radically change our lives and the main lesson we take from these experiences is: our lives cannot be so complex. We own very few things, we rent whenever possible. We lived 12 years in Belgium and we never thought about buying a house. I favor riding my bike instead of my car. As a consequence, we have more dynamic, enriching and fruitful lives. Actually, the only two things I buy a lot are books and pencils.

> I love to cook. So, if I earn the opportunity to work side by side with you I'm the one who will prepare the two pizzas we are going to share as a team.

#### Earn Trust
#### Dive Deep
#### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
#### Deliver Results

## Technical

### Compute

#### EC2
#### Lightsail

Rapid deployment of a website.

#### Elastic Container Service
#### Lambda
#### Batch
#### Elastic Beanstalk

### Networking

#### AWS Direct Connect

Dedicated network connection between your on-premises network and AWS.

### Analytics

#### EMR

Elastic Map-Reduce, which is a managed Hadoop instance.

### Developer Tools

### IoT

The one thing people must understand about IoT is it's a master tool for perceiving the environment. I see people running their applications in really small devices to prove they're lightweight, building clusters of Raspberry Pis. I think they're missing the point. IoT is about sensors, contexts and fast feedback. This is not "one thing" solution, but a collection of things sensing multiple variables to make a collective decision and give a straight and distinguishable feedback.

## Questions

* I see you are also looking for professionals for positions like senior solution architects. How often do you promote from within as opposed to looking outside ?

* What's the career path for the position of Solution Architect?

* Did you ever had the opportunity to talk to Andy or Jeff in person? Are they approachable?

## Conclusion

Thank you very much for the interview. It was a very good self-discovery experience. I few I'm a better person now than a week ago and it was great to know more about all services AWS provides. It really is the state of the art.
