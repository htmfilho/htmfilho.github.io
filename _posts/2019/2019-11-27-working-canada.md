I had no previous experience, no future plans, and no ambition to work on Internet of Things, but when I recently decided to do a career move I didn't expect to do a career shift as well. But it happened and I'm loving it!

In my post [Settling in Canada][2018-07-15], I have shortly narrated how I got my first job in Toronto. A good technical fit in a fintech company. I was a tech lead in a team of three programmers, a business analyst, a test automation engineer and a product owner. We were in charge of the asset servicing business, which basically means managing the offering of investment products and the math after trades completion. It was a challenging and rewarding job and I would stay there for a long time if it wasn't for the increasing work overhead and the conformism with the legacy. After a year and a half working together, I felt I was not fitting anymore. So I decided to make myself available for new opportunities.

Normally, things get better after the first Canadian experience. If you managed to be hired, go through the three months probation period, and be stable in the job for at least a year, the market will favor you over newcomers and less experienced people and you even get the chance to negotiate. Being fired makes the situation worse though. So, make sure you are delivering more value than your current pay check.

The interviews started soon after opening for new opportunities on [LinkedIn]. I was not in a hurry - since I was still employed - but recruiters kept me busy all the time. My first interviews were really a mess, given my lack of practice, but I always took notes of what went well and what didn't. As my discourse was refining I was moving further in the recruitment processes, which usually take weeks. For my surprise, the winning job offer took less than 3 business days to run the entire process. It was a perfect match!

A perfect match happens when both parties are happy about who they are meeting and what they are experiencing.
