I never had the opportunity to write about the experience at [Auberge de la Ferme](http://www.aubergedelaferme.com). I will do it in another opportunity because now I just want to share our wine choices for dinner. They have an extensive selection of wines in a big cave and every time we go there we spend a lot of time choosing the right one, hoping it is good enough for the occasion.

This time we made a very good choice at a good price. They are:

## Montravel

We had a gastronomic dinner with 7 services and most of the dishes demanded a white wine. We choose Montravel, that was one of theÂ waiterâ€˜s suggestions. This is a very good 12% dry andÂ fruity wine 2013.

## Julienas

Some of the dishes demanded a red wine. So, we once again accepted one of the waiterâ€˜s suggestions. The dry, 13% red wine JuliÃ©nas 2011.

We still areÂ amateurs in the art of wine appreciation. So, Iâ€™m saving the choices here for the next time ðŸ™‚.
