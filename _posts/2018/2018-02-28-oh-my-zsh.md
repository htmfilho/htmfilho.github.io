[Zsh] (Z shell) is a tool to enhance shell's capabilities. It's indispensable for those working in Unix-based systems. To make Zsh simpler, there is [Oh-My-Zsh], which is a framework for managing the Zsh configuration with the concept of themes. The goal of this post it to get you all set with Oh-My-Zsh on your Debian Linux system.

To start, let's install Zsh:

    $ sudo apt-get install zsh
    $ zsh --version

You may see a version equal or greater than 5.1.1. Next step is the installation of Oh-My-Zsh:

    $ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

When the installation script finishes the command prompt is probably different from before. It means Oh-My-Zsh was successfully installed. If the prompt looks too minimalistic for you, don't panic. Oh-My-Zsh accepts themes and this is just the default one: **robbyrussell**. To change it, go to the home folder, edit the hidden file `.zshrc`, and change the variable `ZSH_THEME` to **bureau**, which is my favorite theme:

    $ cd ~
    $ vim .zshrc
      ...
      ZSH_THEME="bureau"
      ...
    $ source .zshrc

For a complete list of themes, checkout the [theme catalog][theme-catalog]. Make sure you have some time to spare because trying new themes is addictive.

Oh-My-Zsh won't start by default. To activate it we have to type `$ zsh` every time we open a new terminal. If you are convinced that Oh-My-Zsh is your thing, we can make sure it is always available. On the terminal window, select **Edit > Profile Preferences** in the menu. In the new window, go to the tab **Title and Command**, select the field **Run a custom command instead of my shell** and type `zsh` in the **Custom command** field. Restart the terminal to see it in action.

What I love about Oh-My-Zsh is its integration with Git, the smart auto-complete, and all the information it shows in a single prompt. the theme **bureau** shows:

* my location, so I don't have to time `pwd` all the time

* the time, which is useful to know how long the last operation took by comparing the time of the subsequent prompt

* the current branch and its state with a rich set of colorful symbols, when I'm in a Git repository.
