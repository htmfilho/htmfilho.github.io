![Global Pandemic](/images/posts/pandemic.png)

This is a compilation of what I know so far about the pandemic that is in course. I started writing this post in April 2nd and I keep contributing with content as I learn more about the situation. My goal is to compile knowledge today to be used some time in the future in case a pandemic crisis happens again.

Work in progress every day...
