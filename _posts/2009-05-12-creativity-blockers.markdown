Did you already have the experience of going to a meeting with many ideas in mind, willing to share everything and someone there was so rude with you or just ignored you that you decided to close your mind, shut up and do only what was initially planned to do? Yeah! You have faced a creativity blocker. This kind of person is used to be cold, unsociable and too realistic. You can find them everywhere and the easiest way to recognize them is noticing that they donâ€™t believe in you until you prove the contrary.

How to avoid this kind of people? I have no idea. Actually, if you just decide to keep secret about your ideas it is already a good punishment for them. You will make them a little bit more losers.
