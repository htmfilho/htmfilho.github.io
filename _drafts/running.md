To run long distances, I had to learn how to control my pace, to keep it stable over several kilometers. It is all about controlling my rhythm, trying to mimic my previous movement and replicate it to the next movement. When I keep the rhythm stable, I get consistent pace measures over the course. This is important to avoid going too fast at the beginning or too slow at the end.

At the beginning we feel constantly sore. It's thought to be caused by micro-tears in muscles that activates movements we are not used to. As long as the running is gradually progressing, there is nothing to worry about. Time will show you the pain disappear gradually and they rarely come back in the practice is maintained.

Frequent pain in the knees is the most frequent excuse of sedentary people to not start running. They are right that knees hurt with lack of exercises, but they are wrong when using it as an excuse. At the beginning, knees hurt because the tendons and muscles are not strong enough to keep the joints tight together, giving the impression the knees are loose. The feeling is that knees are going to break apart any time soon. But don't worry! If you do not exaggerate at the beginning, starting with very short distances and progressively increasing the effort every week, your knees are going to hurt, but there is no risk of serious injure. You will notice the pain will go away after a month or two of continuous effort. 

Running burns a lot of calories. It helps to lose weight fast if you are disciplined enough to resist rising hunger due to the caloric burn. Instead of closing your mouth, just each enough of good food, cutting out processed food, which contains a lot of fat, sugar, and sodium. Forget about the scale at the beginning because the body retains liquids, increases the intake of calories and muscles gain mass. So, wait at least one month to start seeing encouraging weight loss results.
